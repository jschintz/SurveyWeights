# SurveyWeights
Collection of STATA scripts to aid in the analysis of survey data on consumer financial health:

* take survey responses and cleanse/standardize the data
* apply a financial health score to each respondent
* construct survey weights to assure a representative sample
* output data-dredged crosstabs.  

The project was built with intent that beginner analysts can reuse scripts in a semi-automated fashion, to be later reviewed with subject matter expert in survey weight design
